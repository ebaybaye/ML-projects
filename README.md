# ML-projects

This machine learning project prepared for performance measurement during the Neuefische Data Science Bootcamp. Three people took in the project, and it was completed and presented in 3 days.

## Setup
Use the `makefile` to install the requirements.

## Dataset
The project was using [The Tanzanian tourism data from zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions/tanzania-tourism-prediction/data)

## Folder
- The notebook containing the EDA and baseline model. Can be found [this notebook](/Users/erdem/neuefische/ML-projects/notebooks/EDA and baseline model.ipynb).
- ML models can be found [this notebook](/Users/erdem/neuefische/ML-projects/notebooks/ML Models.ipynb).
- To load the model from disk and to predict the data can be used [here](/Users/erdem/neuefische/ML-projects/predict.py).
- To find best model, pipeline and error analyse can be used [here](/Users/erdem/neuefische/ML-projects/train.py) 
- Presentation for the Stakeholder can be looked [here](/Users/erdem/neuefische/ML-projects/presentation_tanzania.pdf)
